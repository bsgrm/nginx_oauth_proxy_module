TEST DRIVEN:
-----------
1. HTTP and CSRF code and tests to write
   Include CORS headers in error responses

2. Include an error body with a code and message
   https://github.com/usamadar/ngx_hello_world/blob/master/ngx_http_hello_module.c

3. Decryption - I'd like to generate this via an executable + file option
   Once done delete my local access token file

OTHER
-----
CLion setup
Better use of const
Valgrind and memory leaks
Run the official test suite
Complete the builds

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
Update to look and feel the same as the phantom token module.
Keep the development folder for a productive future setup.

PEOPLE COMMUNICATION
--------------------
On the OSS channel, tell people this is coming, but not finished yet and raise interesting points:

- Set the scene that customers put 2 plugins in front of APIs and use them from SPAs
  There is a high level angle of a simple experience for customers, along with some low level details from us

- Use of authenticated AES256 meaning if a man in the middle tampers with bytes there is a decryption error and message rejected
  OpenSSL and how best to deal with it from a deployment viewpoint: link to Zmartzone example

- Phantom Token Plugin update for SPAs (eg OPTIONS / response headers)
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33672689/javascript-jquery-can%C2%B4t-get-www-authenticate-response-header

- End-to-End error experience for SPAs
  It feels a bit cludgy asking SPAs to read a header for some error responses and not others
  My thoughts are to follow standards but also return a JSON body with a code and message payload

OPEN QUESTIONS
--------------
Review all resources carefully and make a list of any code / build instructions I don't understand
