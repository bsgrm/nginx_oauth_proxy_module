Update docs after each area of work and as I consolidate my understanding:

STAGE 1
-------
1. Validate configuration and deal with arrays

2. Get a partial end-to-end flow working with null decryption
   Handle a couple of failure conditions

3. Write an initial test to understand the test setup

4. Do some reading on NGINX module development

5. Get calls to openssl libraries basically working, eg just to create some random bytes

6. Deploy to Docker and run like a customer would, building for a specific Linux platform

STAGE 2
-------
1. Inform people this is coming and post on the oss channel

2. Get decryption properly working and test scenarios similarly to LUA

3. Completion of application level test scenarios

4. Update LUA plugin on a branch, to be aligned with the C plugin

STAGE 3
-------
1. Builds and the .travis.yml file

2. Test certification

3. Releases in the GitHub repo

4. NGINX online

5. Future upgrades
