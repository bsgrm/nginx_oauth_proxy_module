ENVIRONMENT
-----------
1. CLion to attach to nginx - document this with a screenshot

DOC
---
1. Update main README in line with phantom token module:
   Configuration directives
   Loading the module
   Example configuration
   Mention creation of encryption key - with openssl as an example
   Merge to main

FINAL
-----
1. Complete the builds for all Linux flavors and document behavior
   Also redeploy to Docker and follow my own instructions

2. valgrind and checking for memory leaks

3. Run the official test suite

TESTS
-----
1. Child section that overrides parent section during a GET
   Use different encryption key and check this works

2. Separate cookie headers (HTTP/2)

PEOPLE COMMUNICATION
--------------------
On the OSS channel, tell people this is coming, but not finished yet and raise interesting points:

- Set the scene that customers put 2 plugins in front of APIs and use them from SPAs
  There is a high level angle of a simple experience for customers, along with some low level details from us

- Use of authenticated AES256 meaning if a man in the middle tampers with bytes there is a decryption error and message rejected
  OpenSSL and how best to deal with it from a deployment viewpoint: link to Zmartzone example

- Phantom Token Plugin update for SPAs (eg OPTIONS / response headers)
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33672689/javascript-jquery-can%C2%B4t-get-www-authenticate-response-header

- End-to-End error experience for SPAs
  It feels a bit cludgy asking SPAs to read a header for some error responses and not others
  My thoughts are to follow standards but also return a JSON body with a code and message payload
